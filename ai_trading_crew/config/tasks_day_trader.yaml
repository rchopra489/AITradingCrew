    INDIVIDUAL STOCK ANALYSIS SUMMARIES:
    1. News Summary: {news_summary}

    2. Sentiment Summary: {sentiment_summary}  

    3. Technical Indicators Summary: {technical_summary}
    
    4. Fundamental Analysis Summary: {fundamental_summary}

    8. Market Sentiment Summary: {market_sentiment_summary}

    9. Market Technical Indicators Summary: {market_technical_summary}

    Your task is to synthesize ALL this information to provide the most accurate prediction for {company_name}'s 
    performance during a single trading day (position opened in the morning, closed at end of day).

    significantly outweighs the downside risk. If you predict Very Bearish, it means the potential negative return 
    significantly outweighs the upside potential.
    
    You MUST provide exactly ONE outcome from: Very Bearish, Bearish, Neutral, Bullish, Very Bullish.
